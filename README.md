## General Info
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

Machine Learning approaches:
* Supervised Learning
  * Regression
    * Simple Linear Regression
    * Multiple Regression
    * Polynomial Regression
  * Classification
    * Logistic Regression
    * K-NN
    * SVM
    * Decision Tree Classification
    * Naive Bayes
    * Random Forest Classification
* Unsupervised Learning

These are the algorithms that are used here. The same dataset is used in the algorithms of the same group. 
In that way, it's easier to understand which algorithm is the most accurate for our dataset.
