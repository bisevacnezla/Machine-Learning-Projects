Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

Machine Learning approaches:
* Supervised Learning
              * Regression
                  * Simple Linear Regression
                  * Multiple Regression
                  * Polynomial Regression
              * Classification
                  * Logistic Regression
                  * K-NN
                  * SVM
                  * Decision Tree Classification
                  * Naive Bayes
